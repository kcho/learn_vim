# Task 2. Advnaced
1. Open `neovim`.
2. Start `neovim` terminal.
3. Within `NEOVIM`, create an empty file at `~/vim_test/my_code.sh` and have it opened on your right side of NEOVIM.
4. In the right side of NEOVIM (where you should have opened `my_code.sh` from 4. ), write a code that does the following
  a. Under `~/vim_test` directory, create empty directories in the name of `sub-ME*` IDs under `/data/predict1/data_from_nda/MRI_ROOT/rawdata`
  b. Under `~/vim_test` directory, rename all directories to have `fake-` in front of their directory name.
     - eg) `sub-ME00000` -> `fake-sub-ME00000`
  c. Under `~/vim_test` directory, rename all directories to have `HAHA` instead of `ME` in their directory name.
     - eg) `fake-sub-ME00000` -> `fake-sub-HAHA00000`
  d. Under each directories under `~/vim_text`, create an empty file called as the directory name + `.txt`
     - eg) `fake-sub-HAHA00000` -> create an empty text file `fake-sub-HAHA00000/fake-sub-HAHA00000.txt`
  e. Write the name of the file path inside each text file created from 5. above.
     - eg) write `/PHSHome/kc244/vim_test/fake-sub-HAHA00000/fake-sub-HAHA00000.txt` inside `/PHSHome/kc244/vim_test/fake-sub-HAHA00000/fake-sub-HAHA00000.txt`
